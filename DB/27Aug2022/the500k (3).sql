He was a firm believer in his\r\nreligious practices so he decided to go to temple and offer prayers to gods and\r\ngoddess so that they could get him relieved from the stomach pain.&nbsp; But soon he realized that they are just stone\r\nidols, they are not even able to hear or say anything. He remained helpless in\r\nthat condition, people left him because he was not financial stable, family\r\nlife was disturbed too. But the love of God touched his heart one day, he was\r\ngoing through and heard of songs and worship from a house, where fellowship was\r\ngoing on. He went inside and saw people worshipping the name of Jesus. That day\r\nsomething was there which had stopped him and made him walk inside the church.\r\nThis was the turning point of his life; he then sat there and heard the word of\r\nGod. The holy spirit worked so majestically that he broke down into tears and\r\nbegged to God for healing. He might not know at that time about Jesus. But he\r\nrealized that something great was there at that place. Evangelist Chhatram was\r\nrunning the fellowship there, so he walked to him and asked him about his problems,\r\nafter he told him everything he shared him gospel and introduced Lord Jesus to\r\nhim and prayed for him. He felt good after the prayer; he believed in the name\r\nof Jesus and felt the love of Christ. Evangelist Chhatram counseled him\r\nregularly and was continually praying for his salvation. He started coming to\r\nchurch regularly and learnt so many things from the word of God.

I am doing the\r\nvillage outreach ministry and visit many homes and share the gospel of Jesus Christ\r\nand pray for the people those who are ill and living in problems.\r\n\r\nWe went to a village and met an old man who is aged 74, who\r\nwas living alone and suffered with throat cancer. He was in fear and without\r\nhope. &nbsp;He was abandoned by his family members and relatives.&nbsp; No one\r\ncame forward to help him at his hard time. We prayed for him and comforted him\r\nwith encouraging verses. &nbsp;We showed the\r\nlove of Jesus Christ. We also took him to the government public hospital and admitted him\r\nfor treatment. We looked after him at the hospital day and night for over\r\none week. After one week he was discharged from the hospital and went to\r\nhis village. He was getting better and started to attend prayer meeting. He has\r\ncommitted his life to Jesus Christ after seeing&nbsp;our love, hospitality,\r\nprayer and help. But after 2 months he died unexpectedly. No one came forward\r\nto support for his funeral and burial. We conducted his funeral service at his\r\nvillage. We afforded the coffin and his funeral expenses. His village\r\npeople wondered to see our care towards an abandoned old man and the way we\r\nconducted his funeral service.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;After some days of\r\nhis death, as usual here we conducted a prayer meeting at his village and at\r\nthat time lot of non-Christian people attended the meeting from that village and\r\nwe shared the message regarding our temporary physical life, sufferings, death\r\nand resurrection to those who believe in Christ. We used this opportunity to\r\nshare the gospel of Jesus Christ. The\r\npowerful verses had touched the hearts of many people and made them to think about their future life and\r\neternity. As a result, many people came forward at the end of the meeting for\r\nprayer and some of them committed their life and now they are coming for Sunday\r\nprayer service.\r\n\r\nOne day we went to a street and distributed the tracts (leaflets)\r\nto the people and few women received our leaflets, but other men refused to receive\r\nand surrounded us. They quarreled with\r\nus and threatened and stopped us from distribution. We called another pastor through phone and he came with police to rescue us safely from them.

(80, 243, '2022-08-23', 'Greetings to you in the\r\nname of our Lord Jesus Christ. First, I want to thank 500k for the love and\r\nsupport that you provided me from time to time. It always helped me a lot. I thank\r\nGod for His great calling and the divine purpose that he gave me. This is me\r\nRaman Kumar from Ludhiana. In my family, there is my Dad, Mom, and one elder Sister\r\n(handicapped). We all are committed to the work of God. We do family prayer\r\nevery day and also have discussions on the Word of God. I am blessed that I have\r\na prayerful family who is the backbone of my ministry. When I started my\r\nministry on my own 6 months ago, it was very challenging and very hard for me\r\nto do work in a place where I do not know anybody. I started doing prayer every\r\nday for that place and started visiting there. For the first 3 months, I didn\'t\r\nget any results from my ministry. I was disappointed and was thinking that it\'s\r\nbetter to do some other job. I was thinking I am not called for this ministry. People\r\nused to hear the Gospel but they were not accepting Jesus as their savior. I\r\nwas broken down, but God\'s word was holding me and encouraging me every day. In\r\nthese 6 months, I have learned the value of hardworking. It helped me to have\r\nmore patience and always motivated me to rely on God no matter what. My parents\r\nwere always there to support me in every hardship of my ministry. \r\n\r\nAs I have mentioned before\r\nthat almost 2-3 months I could not see any result in my ministry. Later on, I\r\nwent to a slum area where I found a person whose name is Sanjay. I shared the\r\nGospel with him and God worked in his life he accepted Jesus Christ and through\r\nhim, his family also believed in Him. I started conducting prayer sessions in\r\nhis house. I found that there are different communities of people living there.\r\nI also observe that there are so many children who do not have the privilege of\r\neducation. I met with these children and they were so happy when I shared a\r\nsmall story from the Bible with them. Keeping the children in mind I started\r\nSunday school there. God gave me the heart to help them so that they may know\r\nthe Love that God has shown to us. I am continuing my ministry among them and\r\nall of this is going well.\r\n\r\nEvery week I am conducting\r\nSunday prayer service and also have Sunday school for those children, every week\r\nI use to visit the family members. Recently God worked in the life of\r\nnon-believer through us. A lady came to the meeting because she want healing\r\nfrom her tonsils from which she was suffering for months. God brought her to us\r\nand we prayed for her and I also shared the Gospel with her and told her that\r\nGod loves her and He is willing to heal her but for that, she also needs to\r\nlove God back. She listened to me and started coming to the church and God saw\r\nher willingness to come to Him and He healed her. From that day onwards she is\r\nwith us helping in growing the work of God by praying for us. We together as a\r\ncommunity fast and pray for 3 days every week (Friday to Sunday). I also\r\narranged a meeting in a new believer\'s house and invited their neighbors and\r\nfriends. Many people joined and most of the people heard the Gospel. From this\r\nmeeting, 2 more families came to Christ. \r\n\r\nI had to face many problems, a lot of people say very bad\r\nthings about Christ whenever I share Gospel.&nbsp;\r\nI also had to change my room 3 times because my owners didn\'t like the\r\nprayer meetings. Many times I had to conduct the service in the believer\'s house.\r\nThere is always a risk for my life but as Paul said, for me to live is Christ\r\nand to die is gain, this encourages me to sacrifice all for Christ.&nbsp; &nbsp;In all\r\nthese difficult situations God never let me feel that I am alone but showed me\r\nthe right way to move forward.

I also want to thank 500k for helping me in all the difficult\r\nsituations and for providing me with all the needs that helped in the growth of\r\nboth me and my ministry.\r\n\r\nI am\r\nliving in Kurukshetra (Haryana). In my family, there is my dad, my mom, and\r\nelder brother, two elder sisters, and one younger sister. All are married. My\r\nwhole family is a believer and is involved in the ministry. My father is a\r\npastor and runs his ministry. I sometimes help my father in his ministry but do\r\nnot work with him. I do my ministry and have my own church. \r\n\r\nI started\r\nmy ministry by visiting different people in different places and sharing Gospel\r\nwith them. It was a bit challenging for me to work in a new place. When I\r\nstarted the ministry, I started it with prayer and fasting. At first, nobody knew\r\nme, I started to share the Gospel with people but was not able to get any good\r\nresponses apart from that I was not even having a vehicle and I have to travel\r\nby bus and after that long travel when I was not able to convince people about\r\nJesus Christ as savior, I was going into depression and was disappointed.\r\nPeople were not accepting me and my message. I started to think of leaving the\r\nministry and doing some other job but was not able to leave the ministry\r\nbecause that is the will of God for me. The word of God always encouraged me to\r\nhold the faithfulness of God and to be patient. My family was there to support\r\nme and pray for me. \r\n\r\nAfter 2\r\nor 3 months I found a lady whose name is Shanti. She was suffering from an appendix.\r\nShe used to listen to the Word of God, she has two daughters and two sons. Her\r\nhusband passed away. She accepted Jesus Christ as her Savior. I used to visit\r\nher home and started praying and fellowship with her family. Firstly, I started\r\nto fellowship with them and meet them personally and pray for them and counsel\r\nthem. Then after 2 months, I started Sunday service with them. We all do the\r\nfasting prayer on Wednesdays. Her health is getting much better than before\r\nbecause of the prayers. One more family came to that place and is having\r\nfellowship with God. I also visited the same area and got 2 families in Arnaya\r\nvillage and God used me in that house too. In my church, we do Sunday service\r\nand all the families come there to praise and worship God. Apart from that I\r\nalso run Sunday school and teach children with Bible stories, examples, songs,\r\netc.&nbsp; I also established a new church in\r\nKirti Nagar and people started coming there also. \r\n\r\nI would\r\nlike to finish my report with a personal testimony. My wife was pregnant and\r\ndoctors had told us that she would not be able to deliver the child without\r\ngetting operated on. We were worried but we did not stop praying and trusting\r\nthe Lord. In the end, against the declarations of the doctors, my wife\r\ndelivered the baby without any operation and both baby and the mother are in\r\nperfect health. I give all the glory to God.\r\n\r\nComing\r\nback to the ministry, till now everything is going great and I am also thinking\r\nof some new ideas to make the ministry more effective.

My\r\nministry is growing by God’s grace. \r\n\r\nDuring\r\nthese 6 months, I have been involved in various types of ministries. I and my\r\nfamily were fully involved in doing the work of God. I live in Himachal Pradesh\r\nand the temperature there is very low during the winter season and that is why\r\nsnowfall is very common here. Because of the snowfall, it was really difficult\r\nfor us to do house visits and prayer meetings, and also people were not able to\r\ncome to the church for Sunday meetings because of the same reason. But we came\r\nout with an idea and rather than visiting each others’ places and risking our\r\nlives we decided to do online meetings and that was great we all used to meet\r\non the zoom meetings and there my wife and congregation lead us in the songs\r\nand I shared the Word of God. People were not left without the Word of God. We\r\nalso were able to distribute around 200 calendars that have Bible verses on\r\nthem. While distributing them we got stuck in the snow which is why our 2 hours\r\njourney got converted into 6 hours journey, the place where we got stuck was\r\nfilled with wild animals but the Lord helped us and brought us out safely.\r\nAfter that when I reached home my health got very bad and I was not able to do\r\nanything for one week. \r\n\r\nI used to\r\nteach people through Christian movies. I and my congregation used to spend time\r\nin each others’ houses reading Bible and worshiping. I also took Bible Study Sessions\r\nin which I taught about how a godly family should live, what is the true Gospel\r\nand how to make your children obedient and I got good responses from the\r\nbelievers. All these activities brought a lot of change to our congregation. People\r\nare more effective in doing the work of God. They proactively ask me what they\r\ncan do for Lord, and seeing that the believers are also taking part in God’s\r\nwork makes me so happy. In April the season starts getting better so this month\r\nwe visited all our believers’ houses and encouraged them by the Word of God and\r\nprayer. Visiting is hard for us because my family has to walk for 2 or 3 hours\r\nto reach the villages.\r\n\r\nDuring\r\nthese months I also shared Gospel in different villages and I got three new families\r\nin the kingdom of God. I decided to visit 20 villages but I reached only 18\r\nbecause traveling is an issue here. I cannot walk to every village and if I use\r\nmy small car then the petrol expense can go up to 8,000, that is why I was able\r\nto reach only 18 villages but still, God is the provider and He will provide.\r\nApart from that I also started doing ministry in four new places. The number of\r\npeople is very less right now but my family and the congregation are praying\r\nfor the ministry in these places. \r\n\r\nI want to\r\nfinish with three testimonies that God has raised in the last few months in our\r\nchurch. A lady named Pooja was being oppressed by a demonic possession for more\r\nthan 3 years who was delivered. This led to the salvation of her whole family\r\nin the following days including her husband and two children. Next, a man named\r\nManiram Negi, who was a priest worshipping idols and leading others in the\r\nsame, has accepted the Lord. We have been visiting this man for more than a\r\nyear sharing the gospel and praying for him and God has finally brought to\r\nfruition our prayers by bringing him to the fold along with his family. His\r\nfamily was also under the powers of darkness. His brother used to starve himself for\r\ndays also suffering sleepless nights. God has delivered him as well and now we\r\nare have started a fellowship in their house where people are meeting\r\ncontinually to pray and read Scriptures. All glory to God. Finally, I also want\r\nto share a testimony of what God has done in our family. My 82 years old\r\nmaternal grand mother has accepted the Lord Jesus Christ. She was sick when I\r\nreceived a call from her and went to see her. She was brought back to life\r\nafter 10 minutes of her inactive state after we all kept praying for her. Praised\r\nbe the name of the Lord.\r\n\r\nLastly, I\r\nrequest you to pray that whatever God wants may be fulfilled in my life.\r\n\r\nThank you!', '[\"Pray that the Lord may help in the growth of ministry.\",\"Pray that may the Lord help my family to grow more spirituality. \",\"\"]', 0, 10, 2022, 1, '[[\"v1\",\"Kashmir Village\",\"25\",\"25\"],[\"v2\",\"Barange\",\"5\",\"0\"],[\"v3\",\"Runag\",\"3\",\"3\"]]', 1, 'http://app.the500k.com/uploads/missionary_report/New_report_of_jan_to_june.docx', 'THE_HOPE_SOCIETY_2022_R1_Bhardwaj.jpg', 7, 1),

Myself and my family both grew a lot stronger in our\r\nfaith than before. In my family we all study the Bible together, we pray\r\ntogether, and we do intercession prayer also. My family also helps me in the\r\nSunday ministry.

Some of them\r\nhave family issues like fighting, drugs, no work to fulfill family needs, etc. We\r\nall as a church family are praying for them.

We give all praise\r\nto God that he is helping us very much and not letting us go into any\r\ntemptations.

The\r\nnumbers also increased by the grace of God. I preached the Gospel to more than\r\n150 people and many of them started coming to the church and are now having\r\nfellowship with us. For those who came in these 6 months, I gave them the\r\nteaching about Baptism and baptized those who were ready. \r\n\r\nEvery\r\nweek I conducted a meeting at my house. 30 to 40 people Gathered here for\r\nworship. While doing house meetings I always tell the believers to invite their\r\nnon-Christian friends in the meeting and then in the meeting I share the Gospel\r\nand sometimes share my testimony so that they may see how great our God is.\r\n\r\n<span>I had faced a lot of outside forces to stop the ministry I am\r\ndoing but I and my congregation are standing firm in our faith and dealing with\r\nlove with those who are opposing us. I\r\nhave a big vision for our church I want to see big ministry in my village and\r\nfor that, I need your prayers. I also started a free\r\nsmall education center for children. Its main focus is to share the Gospel with these children\r\nand through them; we are trying to reach out to their parents. </span>\r\n\r\n<span>Moving towards the end, I want t share two testimonies here. Mr.\r\nSaman and his family came in contact with us in a time of great trouble. The\r\nwife was pregnant with twins and doctors had told them that an operation would\r\nbe necessary or else the life of the children was in danger. However, the\r\noperation not only put the life of the children in danger it also brought great\r\ndanger to the life of the mother herself. We prayed and continued to believe\r\nthe Lord. Both babies were born healthy and normally without operation and the\r\nmother was kept out of any danger as well. All glory to God. <br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Charna Singh, from village\r\nKuti Dhani, was a drug addict, creating trouble for his family. God has\r\ndelivered him from the addiction and now he is growing in faith in Jesus\r\nChrist.</span>\r\n\r\nThis is my humble request for you to please continue to pray for\r\nmy ministry.

(85, 256, '2022-08-26', 'Greetings to all in the\r\nname of Lord Jesus Christ! I am Pastor Kamlesh Kumar from Uttarakhand. My\r\nfamily is doing great in the Lord. Both my father and mother are good believers\r\nand always encourage me and my brother to do the work of the Lord.&nbsp; \r\n\r\nThe\r\nministry experience of these 6 months has been great for me. We celebrated the\r\nNew Year in Fathepur and there I preached from the Word of God. I did the\r\nSunday ministry in a village called Kundeshwari. Not only that I also went to\r\ndifferent places to preach the Gospel as I went to Manjhra Village, Mehashpur\r\nVillage, Garinegi Village, Kaashampur village, Salempur village, and many more.\r\nIn these places, I shared the Word of God with the non-believers and had a\r\ngreat time there doing the work of God. Many people believed that Our God is\r\nthe only true God but many rejected the message. I also faced opposition there\r\nbut still, it was great.\r\n\r\nLater on,\r\nI started doing the ministry by visiting the believers of my church. In the\r\nhouse meetings we did worship and I shared from the Word of God it was a good\r\ntime in which we encouraged each other to grow more in Christ. In February I\r\nalso went to different villages again to share the Gospel. I went to Gohavar\r\nvillage, Khnapur village, Kishanpur village, and Sherkot Village. This is one\r\nof the ways I do ministry. I went to different places and meet strange people\r\nand share the Gospel with them. Sometimes I also went to the believer\'s family\r\nand there meet new people and share the Gospel with them.\r\n\r\nDuring\r\nthese months when I went to Mehashpur village somebody called the police there\r\nto catch me but praise to God that somebody informed me this before the police\r\ncame so I ran off from there. Furthermore, I shared the Gospel with 5 people in\r\nMohdinpur village, and 3 people in Sherkot village. I organized a fasting\r\nprayer meeting in Kishanpur, around 10-15 people came there. We had a great\r\ntime together. I also baptized new believers and they are doing pretty good in\r\nthe church. On Good Friday when we were doing the ministry in the church the\r\npolice and so they stopped the meeting in Garinegi village. This is something I\r\nalways face while doing the ministry, it is hard to do ministry here but God\r\nhas helped me in all these difficult situations. Later on, I went to Chandigarh\r\nfor a seminar and I taught everything to the church, the things that I learned\r\nfrom there. In May again I went to different villages and shared the Gospel with\r\nat least 30 people. I also organized a two days seminar in Rahungali Village,\r\nSakarthal Village, and Deengpath Village. The result of the seminars was great.\r\n\r\nFinally,\r\nI want to share some testimonies that God has been doing in our midst. A woman\r\nname Poonam had lost her eye sight and doctors had told her that nothing can be\r\ndone now. We continued praying for her that God restored her eyesight\r\nmiraculously. Another man was delivered from demonic possession and is praising\r\nGod with us. My father’s feet got hurt badly and God healed him quickly as\r\nprayed for him trusting Him for healing. I also wanted to go to many places but\r\ncould not go as the Spirit did not lead me there. \r\n\r\nThis is\r\nhow I did the ministry during these 6 months. I am moving further with a vision\r\nof spreading Christianity to the unreached people. Pray, that may the will of\r\nGod may be done in all this planning.\r\n\r\nThank\r\nyou!', '[\"Please pray for my ministry\",\"\",\"\"]', 0, 10, 2022, 1, '[[\"v1\",\"Bijnore\",\"30\",\"10\"]]', 1, 'http://app.the500k.com/uploads/missionary_report/Kamlesh,_6_Months_Report_(jan_to_June_202).docx', NULL, 7, 1),

In my family, I have my parents, two sisters, and one brother, and all\r\nthree of them are married. In my family only I and my mother believe in Jesus\r\nChrist and everybody else are non-believer. I and my wife are together in doing\r\nthe ministry, we have a three year old son. My family are doing ministry for 3\r\nyears in Fathebad (Haryana) this place is 170km far from my hometown.&nbsp;During these 6 months, I and my family faced a lot of\r\nproblems both in ministry and at home. We changed around 4 houses continuously.\r\nBecause of the housing issue, I started the prayer meeting in one of my church\r\nmember’s houses named Vinod. In Vinod’s house people started to come and we\r\nstart doing our meetings there. We also faced problems because of the lockdown.\r\nI was not able to go out for the ministry or to visit my church family. My\r\nfamily\'s financial condition was also not good; my wife was also suffering from\r\nthyroid. I and my family were praying continuously to God to show us ways. Our\r\nGood God helped us and I got in contact with The Hope Society.&nbsp; After that Hope helped us a lot, it helped me\r\nto reach out to people for the ministry. When I shared the Gospel with people\r\nmany rejected it but some accepted it and repented for their sins and accepted\r\nJesus Christ as their savior. God has blessed me in the ministry by giving me\r\nnew believers to shepherd. I also went place to place in Fathebad Cities and\r\nvillages to share the&nbsp;Gospel. To&nbsp;encourage the church, we are doing three days of fasting\r\nand prayer meetings with the believers, in this we all come together and share\r\nour problems, we pray for each other and share the word of God to encourage\r\nthem in Christ. We sing songs and this is how I motivate my church in doing the\r\nWork of God and to get strong in their faith. In Sunday ministry about 20\r\npeople come and involve them in the ministry, the church also follows the\r\nsacraments that are mentioned in the Bible. 15 members of the church are\r\nbaptized. I am trying to encourage people so that those who are remaining may\r\nalso get baptized. I also run Sunday school with a few children. I went to a\r\nseminar also where I preached the word of God and baptized four people. God is\r\nusing me for his work very much even though I faced persecution by some people\r\nand they want me to stop preaching but still I am looking forward to spreading\r\nthe word of God as much as God wants me to.&nbsp;A few things that the Lord has done in our church can be\r\nmentioned here. An old man was suffering from diabetes which had resulted in\r\nboils on his body and he wasn’t getting any better with medical treatment. The\r\nchurch prayed for him and God healed him within a week and the whole family is\r\nnow walking with the Lord. Another man, Neeraj, was drinking alcohol and was planning\r\non leaving army job due to his growing habit of drinking. His family brought\r\nthe concern to the church and we took the matter before the Lord. He left\r\ndrinking and decided to go back to army. We all praise God for that. Not only\r\nthis, but a lady named Suman was not able to conceive from last three years and\r\nnow has a beautiful baby girl as the church prayed with her. \r\n\r\nIn the\r\nend, I &nbsp;want to thank 500k, for helping\r\nme to fulfil&nbsp;my vision. You are doing a great job by helping God’s people to do\r\nGod’s work effectively.

During these 6 months, the work of God in my ministry was\r\ngreat. I and my family grew more in our relationship with God. At first only I\r\nand my wife Shalu were believers, my whole family used to make fun of us but\r\nlater on as we both husband and wife prayed to God regarding our family, God\r\nanswered our prayers and now my whole family believes in Jesus Christ and takes\r\npart in the ministry also. We together serve God in ministry.&nbsp;When I started my ministry I faced a lot of problems like\r\nfinancial problems, mental problems, and sometimes physical problems also but\r\nin all these situations God was always with us and delivered us from these\r\nproblems. I am thankful for 500k as I was facing a lot of financial problems\r\nbut God sent you guys to help me in fulfilling God’s work. Because of you, I am\r\nnow able to do much more new things for the ministry that seemed impossible to\r\nme one time.&nbsp;As time is passing my ministry is growing. I am also\r\nstarted doing the house visits, and the prayer meetings every weekend. Apart\r\nfrom that I also evangelize to non-believers and sometimes believers also\r\nbecause they also need constant edification. The way I evangelize is that I go\r\nhouse to house to tell people about the Gospel. While doing this I faced a lot\r\nof problems recently while I was having a prayer meeting in my church, some\r\npeople came and threatened us that they are going to file a case against us and\r\nthat if we did not stop doing this they will kill us. But I and my congregation\r\nare not afraid of them because nothing bad can happen to those who are children\r\nof God. Even though the persecution is there I am still doing the house\r\nvisiting and people themselves call me and ask me to come. This encourages me a\r\nlot because this shows that the people of my congregation are growing in\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also want to share how God is working in our church, two\r\nmonths back a family came in the church asking us to pray for their daughter Seema\r\nwho was having a problem with her lungs which is why she was not able to eat or\r\ndrink. Her family was doing everything they can to heal her. For about six\r\nmonths they were trying to give her the best treatment but nothing was helpful\r\nand so they came to the church. Our whole church members prayed for her and God\r\nhealed her and now she is healthy. She and her family accepted Jesus Christ as\r\ntheir savior and are now members of our church.\r\n\r\nI still\r\nam trying to do a lot more things for the ministry and praying that God may\r\nprovide me with everything necessary for the growth of his people.

In 2017 God blessed us with beautiful\r\ndaughter Sharon Matthew. My father is a Pastor; I was working as assistance\r\nPastor with him, and my wife was involved in Sunday school ministry. \r\n\r\nFor past many years we were\r\npraying for a town in district Moga, called Fatehgarh Panjtoor. There was not a\r\nsingle Christian family in that town. We had burden for planting Church in this\r\ntown, so that perishing souls can have eternal life. In January 2022 we decided\r\nmoving to this town, it was really very challenging and very hard for us to do\r\nwork in the new place where we don’t know anyone. We started praying with\r\nfasting for that place and started making relationships with neighbors and shop\r\nkeepers. It took almost 3-4 months to make good relationship and good image in\r\nthe community. From the first day we never miss chance to share about Jesus\r\nChrist with people. Many people used to hear the Gospel but they don\'t accept\r\nJesus as their personal savior. Sometimes, it was disappointing for me, but\r\nGod\'s word was really holding me and encouraging me every day. My wife and 4\r\nyear old daughter were always there to support me in every hardship of ministry. \r\n\r\nIn April 2022 we have begun\r\nconducting free evening classes for children hoping to reach more families\r\nthrough it.

It is such a blessed time for my ministry and my family.\r\nIn my family, we do devotions together. We study our bible and worship\r\ntogether, we pray together for each other and for those who share their prayer\r\nrequests with us. We are growing stronger in our faith together and God is\r\nworking among us. One of the work that God has shown in my family which has\r\nbecome a great testimony for me is that I have an elder brother who was not a\r\nChristian at first but God worked in his life and showed him the right way. In the\r\nchurch, we used to pray for him every time and it is a joyful&nbsp;moment for all\r\nof us because God has answered our prayers by saving him. God has worked in our\r\nlives by providing us with everything we need.

All the believers meet\r\ntogether every Sunday. In ministry, recently I have learned so many new things,\r\nlike how we can share Gospel with others. How much important it\'s to reach to\r\nunreached. I always teach in the church whatever I learn and this is how we are\r\ngrowing together in our knowledge of God. I would love to tell you now that my\r\nchurch and I are growing in our spiritually. In the beginning, I was the only person\r\nwho uses to go out to share Gospel but now I have trained my church members to\r\npreach the Gospel. Now with the hard work of my church believers, new families\r\nare coming to Christ. They are doing good in sharing the Gospel and doing the\r\nwork of God. God has shown a lot of healing miracles in the church that encouraged\r\nthe believers to depend upon Him. One of the recent healing that happened is, that\r\na sister name Harwas Kaur used to come and pray for her neck problem which she\r\nwas facing for several months but we as a congregation stood up and prayed for\r\nher and she got sudden healing by God’s grace, this healing showed people that\r\nGod is working among us. \r\n\r\nAlso, we\r\nnot only are focused on mature people but are also doing Sunday school\r\nministries for children where we help them to be mature in Christ and to follow\r\nthe steps given by our Lord Jesus Christ in the Bible. We help them to learn\r\nthrough stories, movies, books, etc. we are encouraging them to read the Bible\r\nby telling them stories from the Bible and giving them homework that includes\r\nBible study. We are teaching them how to pray and also that they should respect\r\nelders and are helping them in being good children of God. There is a total of 30-40\r\npeople who come to the church every Sunday and in children\'s ministry, we have\r\n15-20 kids. I also am trying to establish more leaders from the church who can\r\ntake further the work of God and for that, I also do seminars, youth meetings,\r\netc.&nbsp; Everything is going well in the\r\nministry and God is helping in spreading his work through us, the only issue is\r\nthat we are not allowed to speak in public about Christ because that would be\r\nconsidered as something wrong against the other religions but we still are\r\ntrying to reach people no matter how big the risk is there.

My name\r\nis Darshan Singh I am from the Fatehgarh district and I minister in this place.\r\nIn my family, we are three of us, I, my wife, and my 4 years old daughter. We\r\nall are involved in the ministry. \r\n\r\nIn the\r\nprevious months, I went to some seminars, and there I learned a lot of new\r\nthings from the Bible and especially from the life of Paul. I learned how can\r\none evangelize by following the steps of Paul. There in the seminar, some ways\r\nwere told to us that equipped us to do the ministry more effectively. I\r\nprepared my notes and taught the same things in my church also and the\r\ncongregation learned a lot from that. Many said to me that now they are not\r\nafraid of sharing the Gospel because they know how to do it. \r\n\r\nAlso, I\r\nsuffered a lot because there is a wound on my leg that makes walking difficult.\r\nI was not able to do the ministry but my wife helped me a lot in the ministry\r\nwork. For the past two-three months, I am on the bed and I am not able to walk\r\naround. I am taking medicine but it is taking a lot of time, doctors said that\r\nit needs to be operated on. Because of the leg problem, I used my scooter to\r\nreach the villages but the scooter also needs service for which we do not have\r\nmoney which is why it mostly does not work. Even with a lot of difficulties we\r\nboth are still doing our job given by God. We shared the Gospel with\r\nnon-believers and also distributed the New Testaments to people. \r\n\r\nIn my church 20-25 people come every\r\nSunday from which 10 people have taken Baptism and we are also preparing the\r\nremaining ones to be baptized by teaching them about the importance of baptism.\r\nApart from that my wife also takes Sunday school and she teaches Christian\r\nsongs, action songs, Bible truths, and stories that help the children to grow\r\nin the Lord Jesus Christ. God has shown a lot of miracles in our church one of\r\nthem that happened recently is that a new believer came in our church named Manjeet,\r\nshe was demon-possessed and went to a lot of places to find the solution but\r\nnobody was able to help her and then she came to the Sunday ministry because\r\nsomeone insisted her to join and during the service she listened to everything\r\ncarefully and learned about Christ, when the whole congregation was praying for\r\nher, the Lord showed his power upon her and she got delivered from the demon.\r\nNow she is coming to the church with her family and shares this testimony of\r\nher with non-believers. By the grace of God, I also bought a place for the\r\nchurch for which I still have to pay Rs.60,000. We don’t have money but we have\r\nGod who will provide for us. This is how we are doing our ministry by depending\r\non our one and only true God. I and my wife are thankful to 500K for supporting\r\nus and through that showing us the love that God has shown to his people. We\r\nare doing much greater in our ministry because of your help.

My\r\nelder brother is also doing ministry in Muktsar. Right now I am doing my\r\nministry with my wife who is also a graduate in Biblical studies, in Rangri Khera.\r\nAt first, we faced a lot of problems but now we are doing well. We were doing\r\nthe ministry by earning money from labor work but recently we decided to just focus\r\non our ministry and the Lord helped us in that, and till now our ministry is\r\ngoing well. &nbsp;We started our church with 4\r\npeople and my wife used to travel by foot to every village with me to do the ministry\r\nand to share the Gospel. We both were praying to buy a second-hand bike but we\r\ndo not have enough money. God worked in our lives in a way that no one else can\r\ndo. He send a helper to us and he told us that he wants to help us because this\r\nwas commanded by God to him and he bought a bike for us, all praise to God. With\r\nthe help of a bike, I was able to share the Gospel with 200 Non-Christians and\r\nmore than 50 people accepted Jesus Christ as their savior. Furthermore, I also\r\nbaptized those who accepted Jesus, first, I gave them the teaching about\r\nBaptism and then I baptized 30 people in these months. \r\n\r\nAs for now,\r\nwe are doing our ministry in a rented apartment, and in this apartment, we do\r\nour Sunday ministry, and also on Friday, we do prayer and fasting meetings. The\r\nchurch believers also do men and women meetings on Thursday nights and in this\r\nmeeting, I teach them the different ways of reaching the unsaved people and\r\nabout how they can share the Gospel by being an example in their neighborhood.\r\nThe Sunday school ministry is also going on in the church.&nbsp; Right now 50 people are coming to the church.\r\nWe also train these people for missionary work. Also, God has worked in a great\r\nway in our church, a brother in the church was suffering from a kidney stone\r\nand when we prayed for him God healed him and also one of the great things that\r\nhave happened is our landlord who was at first was not supportive regarding the\r\nSunday meeting in the house got ill and asked us to pray for him and God\r\nanswered our prayer and when he saw the greatness of our God, he gave his life\r\nto Lord Jesus Christ and now is doing ministry with us and also raises no\r\nobjections to the Sunday meeting. \r\n\r\nOur\r\nministry is going well but with that, we are also facing persecution from the\r\nvillagers as they do not want us to do ministry there and are giving us threats\r\nof killing but we are still doing the work of God. One more thing that has happened\r\nis that in Haryana the Anti-Christians Conversion Law has passed because of\r\nwhich there is a risk for us in ministry and because of this we have to do\r\nministry secretly. But God has his plan for us and we believe that it is for our\r\ngood and so we are continuously doing the ministry even after knowing the risk.\r\n\r\nThank\r\nYou!', '[\"Pray for the growth of my ministry.\",\"\",\"\"]', 0, 10, 2022, 1, '[[\"v1\",\"Rangri Khera\",\"35\",\"25\"]]', 1, 'http://app.the500k.com/uploads/missionary_report/6_months_report_(Jan_to_June_2022).docx', 'THE_HOPE_SOCIETY_2022_R1_saleem.jpg', 7, 1),

They all attend Sunday service,\r\nFriday service, Saturday night service, etc. I always encourage them to do the\r\nwork of God by giving them examples from the Bible and they have learned a lot\r\nthrough that and are getting stronger in their faith. They are not afraid of\r\nsharing the Gospel outside the church. They take initiative and go out together\r\nto share the Gospel. Furthermore, they always prioritize reading Bible and prayer\r\nand that is why they have good knowledge of the Bible. Those who do not know how\r\nto read spend their time mostly in prayer and listen to the word very carefully\r\nwhenever I share.\r\n\r\nFor the\r\nChildren, I have made some leaders who are handling the Sunday school ministry\r\nand they teach children from the Bible and help them to learn the significance\r\nof Christian life.

One thing that\r\nI learned from their life was not to lose hope in Christ. as they continued\r\ncoming to church and praying with us God saw their faith and answered our\r\nprayer. The man is healthy now and his family is still with us praising and\r\nserving the Lord with their lives. Along with that God has also helped me in\r\ndelivering the people who are suffering from demon possessions, He has delivered\r\neach one of those who came in the church asking for deliverance.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;God has helped us a lot in doing all these\r\nthings and we are praying that may God help us to grow more in quantity and\r\nquality.

I am very grateful to you all. \r\n\r\nMy name\r\nis Peter John and I am from Ludhiana. During these 6 months, the Lord helped me\r\nin winning many souls. When I first started doing ministry in January by sharing\r\nthe Gospel to people I always used to get bad responses from them. They used to\r\nget angry and sometimes start fighting. It was very difficult for me but the\r\nLord gave me the courage and strength to overcome these little problems. To\r\nreach the people with less difficulty, rather than roaming around on road and\r\nspeaking with people, I started going door to door and sharing the Gospel with\r\nthose who welcomed me in their houses. This idea worked and I was able to\r\npreach the Gospel to more than 70 families within these 6 months. The people in\r\nthe congregation increased and I baptized those who joined. \r\n\r\nIn the\r\nchurch, the believers are getting strong in their faith. Their testimonies make\r\nus more stable in our faith. They always come on time and start the ministry,\r\nthey listen to the word properly and ask questions and that is why for the spiritual\r\ngrowth of people I also organized a Bible Study Session for elders so that they\r\nmay face the opposition in a good way through the knowledge of the Bible.\r\nBecause the people here never stop asking questions and are trying to prove\r\nChristianity wrong, I am preparing the people of my congregation to give those\r\nwho oppose Christianity meaningful and convincing answers from the Bible.\r\n\r\nAlso, to\r\nmature the children in Christ I prepared a Bible Study Plan for 6 months and\r\ngave them the chart to work on that. This helped the children to read their\r\nBible in 6 months and it worked well. The children in the Sunday School became\r\nvery active in the past few months. Every Sunday they prepare a song or dance\r\nto present in the church. The parents are very happy to see their children\r\ngrowing in the knowledge of Christ. \r\n\r\nThere are a few things I want to share\r\nthat the Lord has done in our midst during the period of the last 6 months. There\r\nwas a lady who joined us. The demonic manifestations were frequent in her\r\nfamily and now her son was also being oppressed by the demonic powers. We kept\r\npraying for them and the Lord delivered both, the lady and her son. Sometime\r\nlater, the whole family came into the faith and were baptized. All glory to\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nMy church\r\nfamily is doing great and so are I and my family. The Lord is providing us with\r\nall necessary things. We are trying to start free tuition for children and also\r\nsome tailoring work for women so that they may get help from this.

We also\r\norganize fasting prayer meeting from 10:30am to 1:30pm on every Friday. &nbsp;We meet many people and share the\r\ngospel and pray for them during our outreach ministry. We usually distribute leaflets\r\nand pray for the&nbsp;sick people. Some will receive our gospel tracts,&nbsp;and some will refuse and even some people will&nbsp;resist to do this ministry. <br></span>\r\n\r\n<span><br>One man named “Prakash” who was a non-Christian&nbsp;had\r\nattended our prayer meeting a few times earlier with enthusiasm. But after his\r\nwedding with a non-Christian&nbsp;woman he lost interest and stopped from attending our&nbsp;prayer meetings. &nbsp;We came to know that he was addicted&nbsp;to alcohol and was quarrelling&nbsp;and\r\nfighting with his wife and there was no peace at his family. His mother was not\r\nhappy with his behavior after his wedding.&nbsp;\r\nShe was telling&nbsp;her daughter in law that until he was attending the\r\nprayer meeting,&nbsp;he was behaving well and after his wedding, when he stopped from attending\r\nprayer meeting,&nbsp;he is behaving like this. She invited us to pray for her son and\r\nwe visited that family and prayed for them and also shared the gospel to them. After\r\nour visit, initially&nbsp;his wife only came\r\nto church regularly with interest and has accepted Jesus Christ as her personal\r\nSavior and has got baptism. After some time&nbsp;he also came to church along with\r\nhis wife and now he has also repented and has come out of alcohol addiction and has accepted Jesus Christ and both of them are living peacefully now. They are\r\ncoming to our church regularly and also they are interested in the children\r\nministry.

We did some counseling and prayed for them and&nbsp;after our&nbsp;prayer and counseling that man promised\r\nthat he will behave well with moral character and take care of his wife well\r\nwithout hurting her and he has also decided to work at nearby place instead of going&nbsp;too&nbsp;far places.

So, I take my bike to their places and\r\nbring them one by one to the church slowly with patience. I know it is a risky job to bring them by bike,&nbsp;but they are telling that they are happy when they attend&nbsp;Sunday worship service.
