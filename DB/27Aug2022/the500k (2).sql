When I had shared the word of God, they heard the word of God and accepted Jesus Christ as personal savior and started to come to faith. Please pray for them that they may stand firm in faith.  God brought a family to faith. Whole the family were suffering different kinds of sickness and weakness due to the works of evil spirits. At that time they went too many hospitals but they were not healed. During that time they came to know about Jesus Christ through some of the believers. They believed in the name of Jesus Christ and started to come to Christ. When they started to come to faith God touched them and healed them completely. Now they and they family accepted Jesus Christ as their personal savior and became very strong in their faith. By the grace of God and your prayers we are not facing any kind of opposition or persecution in our place and ministry. In the past month we had wonderful cluster meeting at our supervisor church. All of the members those who under him joined with us then we had sung some songs, read the word of God and our supervisor shared the word of God. After the word of God we shared our testimonies and prayer requests.  At last we prayed for the sponsors, NCM directors and missionaries.', '[\" Please do pray for the growth of the ministry. \\t \",\"Please pray for ministry that we are need of a church building.\",\"Please pray for the believers those who are coming newly to faith.\",\"Please pray for me that I may reach unreached villages in the coming days. \",\"Please pray for me and my family that God keep us safe and sound under His wings. \",\"Please pray for the people those who are affected with Covid-19 in our village. \"]', 0, 6, 2022, 2, '[[\"v1\",\"Kuch Chah Persia\",\"10\",\"3\"]]', 1, 'http://app.the500k.com/uploads/missionary_report/', './uploads/missionary_report/Saleem_Thomas.png', 2),

Moreover. he had to take pain relieving injection three or four times a week. Still, he had no considerable relief. But hearing about Jesus, faith developed in him, and he surrendered his life to Christ. Now he is completely healed and enjoying the presence of God in his life. In Uttarakhand we could share the gospel with people few years back and established a small church there was severe persecution took place But one family stood firmly against us and opposed our work and he did not allow to share gospel to more people in that village. This time the Lord guided me again to this village and what happened was unbelievable. There I saw the pathetic condition of the family. The evil spirit had been devastating the family. Two of the family members were dead due to evil attack and the whole family was in trouble. They asked me to pray for them and the whole family surrendered their lives to Christ.

My father was the only source of income; he worked as labor in the\r\nfields. &nbsp;All day he worked hard but it\r\nwasn’t sufficient to feed a family of eight members. When I was 11 year old I\r\nsuffered from a skin disease, whenever anyone touched me my skin developed\r\nsevere rashes and it felt like burning. I was living my life in terrible pain\r\nand sadness, I used to be alone at school avoid talking to anyone or making\r\nfriends. I went to temples and prayed to idols offered them flowers. My\r\nchildhood was spent in a miserable condition. <br><br>I got to know about Jesus in 2012\r\nthrough a school mate who was a young girl in my class. She enquired about my\r\nsadness and suggested me to come to church with her. That day we both decided\r\nto go to the church, when I went there worship was going on and everyone was\r\npraising Jesus. I wondered who Jesus is because I never heard about him before.\r\nI went there with the hope to get healed. I met Pastor Kamal Dev in the church,\r\nhe shared the word of God with me, and the moment he spoke to me I was feeling\r\nsomething getting off my shoulder. I felt peace over my life. I was then filled\r\nwith happiness. I started coming to church regularly learnt songs and many things\r\nfrom there. The mighty hand of God touched me and healed me. In the year 2013 I\r\nreceived healing from God, my family was very happy to see me getting better.\r\nBut it didn’t last long; they began scolding me for going to church and asked\r\nme to work in the field for the family. <br><br>I remember the day when I was 15 year old sleeping I heard someone\r\nasking me to follow him and I believed it was God’s voice for me. At that young\r\nage I was clear with the idea of serving God’s Kingdom. I asked my parents to\r\nlet me go to church but they rebuked me and threw me out of the house. Without\r\nshelter, food or anything I worked as a labor to buy some food and shared\r\ngospel. I was dedicated to God’s voice. Later Ps. Kamal taught me to minister\r\namong people. At the age of 18 I worked as a mechanic and earned my bread. When\r\nmy parents saw my passion for Jesus, there heart was touched. My parents called\r\nme back home. God worked in their lives and they came to church with me. &nbsp;Pastor Kamal suggested me to go to training\r\ncenter in Varanasi to learn Evangelism and the many things. I came here in\r\nVaranasi in March 2020 and my life took an amazing turn afterwards. I have\r\nlearnt the way of sharing gospel effectively and to be in God’s obedience. My\r\nvision is to serve God with all my heart and to reach the people who are still\r\naway from truth. Coming years I plan to set up churches for God’s Glory.&nbsp;', 110, '110_fieldPhoto.jpg', 1),

Following\r\nevery ritual and religious practice I was grown up but never experienced peace\r\nin my life. As i grew up I was into bad company, drinking alcohol and doing\r\nwrong things. <br><br>One day my cousin came to our house, he is a believer in Lord\r\nJesus Christ. While I was walking on the wrong paths, he shared love of God\r\nwith me and gave me gospel. When I got to know about Lord Jesus my life changed\r\nand He transformed me into a whole different person. Now I Am a minister of God\r\nserving people and preparing people for God’s kingdom. As my journey continued,\r\nmy heart was burdened for people who are like me unknown about God and living\r\nlives in darkness. <br><br>I want to help people the same way my brother helped me by\r\nsharing the love of God with them. When I came into faith, I experienced peace\r\nlike nowhere else and love like no other. That moment I dedicated my life to my\r\nonly savior Jesus. I realized that I have been called to minister about God\r\namong people. With this vision in my heart I moved to the Bible Training Center\r\nin Varanasi where I got to know about the basics values and principles of\r\nministry. The teachers were helping me throughout to be a faithful servant of\r\nGod. Whatever I learned during my training at the center is helping me to do\r\nthe ministry work more effectively. As a believer and a servant of God it\'s our\r\nvision to save souls for his kingdom. I am focusing on the people of my area\r\nwho are away from God by counseling them from the word of God and helping them\r\nto get out of the darkness and walk into the light of God. I plan to set up\r\nchurches there in the village area so that people come and gather up for God’s\r\nglory. I will reach out to the people who are unprivileged and ignored certain\r\ntimes. They are struggling with sickness, poverty and many other problems. I\r\nwish to help them with the best I can. The center of my ministry is sharing the\r\nlove of Christ with everyone.

I\r\nused to go to a Roman Catholic Church but never gave praise to God out of my\r\nlife. &nbsp;I was no less than an idolater. With\r\nthe time passing my addiction for alcohol increased and it turned me into a\r\ndifferent person. &nbsp;My family was in\r\ndistress because of the wrong things I had in life and my kids were surrounded\r\nby sickness and problems. Even after knowing that everything is been destroyed\r\nI was not able to make anything right. I tried to go to people but no one\r\nhelped me and even refused to help my family. I was so heartbroken; no hope was\r\nleft in my life. <br><br>When one day evangelist Suman Pakhrin came to minister in our\r\nvillage, he was sharing gospel with people and I heard him and asked him to\r\noffer a prayer for my children as they were terribly sick. When he prayed in\r\nLord Jesus’ name, my kid was healed completely. I witnessed love and mercy of\r\nGod in my life. I regained my faith and hope in Christ and decided to leave\r\neverything else and turn my life to Christ. I started going to Church and\r\nlearned more from the pastors and leaders. God brought a big change in my life\r\nand helped me in the times of troubles. <br><br>It was there in my heart to give glory\r\nto God out my life and decided to go to the training center to learn about\r\nministry to serve God.

The\r\nvision of my ministry is to plant churches in the coming year, churches that\r\nwill give praise to the living God. Going to the training center at Varanasi\r\nUttar Pradesh had helped me to grow more in my vision and guided me in the\r\nright direction. The teachers were encouraging and I learned a lot from their\r\nlives too. The vision of my ministry to come to pass requires a lot of prayers\r\nand hard work among the people. &nbsp;I\r\nbelieve that God is there with me in my journey as a minister serving his\r\nkingdom.

But I lacked\r\nhappiness in my life, even after doing everything the circumstances in my\r\nfamily were not in our favor. My father was not mentally unstable and from last\r\n12 years his condition was getting worse day by day. Because of so many\r\ntroubles going around it was very difficult for me to manage everything. I was\r\nupset and heartbroken seeing my father in a miserable state; he lost his\r\nconsciousness and became totally unstable by mind.

I prayed to God to help me move forward in my\r\ncalling and that I wanted to know more about his word. I was then enrolled into\r\nthe bible training center at Varanasi. It was a great opportunity for me to\r\nlearn about ministry from the teachers. The most significant thing that has\r\nhelped me while in ministry is to be faithful and disciplined for God’s work. Also\r\nthe teachers helped me to sharpen my communication skills and taught me the way\r\nof sharing the word of God.

Planning to plant churches for the God’s\r\nglory. My heart cries when I see people in diseases and problems. There are\r\nmany people who are illiterate and unemployed. Children are dying because no\r\nfood is there for them. I completely believe that we the people of God are\r\ncalled to serve for the purpose of God and to bring people in nearness to\r\nChrist. The community I am planning to work for needs to be educated and self\r\nreliant. So they may grow in life. Moreover they need Jesus, who is the answer\r\nto everything. My church and ministry would be focused on bringing change in\r\npeople’s life through the word of God. In the time of my training I\'ve learnt\r\nhow to uplift people with the word of God.

My parents were so strong in their traditional faith and idol worship and I was also worshiping the Idols with my family.\r\nWhen I was studying at a higher secondary school there was a dispute amidst student groups and there was a lot of problem due to students fight inside school. Because of immoral behavior of some co students, I was also arrested by the police and was taken to the police station and I was released after some time.&nbsp;Due to this problem I felt ashamed amidst teachers, students and family members. I was so sad, felt lonely and was in depression. I decided to commit suicide. So I drank poison but one student saw this and informed to others and I was taken to the hospital immediately and after treatment I was able to survive. After some days I was discharged from the hospital.\r\nBut I an felt emptiness in my life. I hated this life. I felt lonely and abandoned.&nbsp;At this situation a small gospel team visited our area and had gathered children and taught songs and Biblical lessons. I went to that meeting. I liked the songs,moral teaching,message and prayers. I was there till the end of the meeting. Really I was touched by that children meeting . I got peace of mind and joy. <br>I got interested to go to Church. It was Thursday and I was waiting for Sunday and&nbsp;&nbsp;after that I went to a nearby Church on Sundays and heard the words of God and repented from the idol worship and sins and I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior. I was baptized during my higher school studies. After that whenever I had time .I was involving in the ministry with my Church Pastor. I was involving in the Children ministry also. Through many verses and through visiting many pastors I got interested and vision about possible full time ministry in the future. I got the feeling of calling of God in my life. After my college studies I got a job at a company in Karur Town. On Sundays I went to near by Church in Karur. In Madurai each year youth meeting will be conducted at a big ground and usually each year I will attend that youth meeting. When I was doing my job I took leave and went to that meeting and I was touched by the challeging and revival message and at the end of the meeting they made fulfil call. They invited the youth who would like to commit to the Lord`s ministry to come forward. At that time I also felt the calling and committed my life for the Lord`s ministry and went forward.<br>&nbsp;After this meeting I could not concentrate fully in my job. Before joining that job also I had a thought of joining&nbsp; a Bible college to get a proper Biblical studies. So I resigned my job and went to a Bible college in Madurai city. During my Biblical studies I learnt many things and importance of Evangelism and Church planting. I got more burden towards lost souls. After that I was working with a Pastor in the ministry for many years and after getting a lot of experience now recently I have started the Lord`s ministry independently. My vision is to reach out maximum number of people and lead them into Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindly pray for my ministry. Thank you for your support that is blessing me and the ministry.

Even I did not have an own Bible.\r\nEven though I went to Church I felt emptiness in my life. I did not get the real peace and joy. But one day I felt that some one is telling me to read John 10:11. I happened to meet a Pastor named Chelladurai and I asked him about this verse and its meaning and he explained me well and he gave me a new Bible also. From that day onwards I started to read the Bible. Then I went to a nearby Independent Church and heard the words of God regularly. I repented and accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior. I came out of spiritual ignorance and darkness. I got clarity in the spiritual thing. I was baptized. After some times my family members and some of my relatives were also baptized. I went to that Church regularly. In the beginning I attended in the children Bible class and at youth meeting regularly. Later on after some years I got a chance to do Children ministry and Youth ministry at the Church where I attended Sunday worship service. I got more interest to do the Lord`s ministry.

(194, '<span><span>Praise the Lord, I am Raman Kumar, basically from Uttar Pradesh, but I was born and grown up at to place called Ludhiana\r\nin Punjab. My parents has been settled there since 1984 in district Ludhiana. I have a mom, Dad and one elder sister in home. I have studied in Punjab education\r\nBoard till intermediate after that, went to bible college for B.th Degree. Now\r\npursuing M.div from a&nbsp; Bible college in Bangalore. Currently doing independent\r\nministry in Ludhiana. My parents accepted Jesus Christ in 1998, I was just\r\nlittle boy just 5 years old. Although my parents and sister use to go to church\r\nand pray but I was never interested in that. Two years passed but there was no change. My parents always compelled me to go to Church and participate in Sunday school. I was good student in Sunday school to memorize to scripture,\r\nhad good learning mind and narrate to stories from to Bible and had lot of activities&nbsp;in to Church but still life was away from God. There was no change in my life. My school friends were very bad\r\nand I was one of those. I always shows good face to parents and also to to\r\nchurch members but in to the society I was very bad with behaviors. I always\r\nthought that life&nbsp; is to enjoy and always listen to your heart. That&nbsp; was my condition; I was really dead in to spirit. I always used take to\r\nWord of God very lightly and never been serious about it. One day church pastor\r\nhas conducted an Youth meeting in to church for 3 days. They invited a guest\r\npastor there who was working among youth. pastor has told him that Raman you\r\nhave to be there in to meeting. Raman Kumar said; Meeting has been started and\r\nsecond day of to Youth meeting God has really spoken me through to Word. The word\r\nwas \"Know that to LORD, I is God! It is I who made us, and we are yours,\r\nyou are my people, and to sheep of my pasture\" (Psalm 100:3). The Word touched\r\nme and I really cried out and longing for to forgiveness from God from sins\r\nwhich I have made toward Him and tears was continuing rolling from my eyes.\r\n<br>From that day I started meditate on to word of God and started rely on God. I\r\ncompletely gave my life to Lord. Now my life has completely changed and my\r\nschool friends started teasing me and Jesus too. In to beginning I use to get\r\nangry but slowly - slowly Spirit of God started teaching me not to get angry because\r\nthe others are not aware of God\'s love. I said to me that show your love to\r\nthem instead of getting angry on them. It was really challenging moment for me\r\nto Love them who hates and tease me. God has filled me with me with full of joy\r\nand happiness in my life and I also started sharing my love to others. I\r\ndedicated myself to the Lord. My life has totally changed because of word of\r\nGod and God started speaking from My Word. There are so many people who really\r\ndon\'t know to truth and ding every day. God has put burden in my heart for those\r\npeople. From that day I started sharing to Love of God among them. First I\r\nstarted sharing God\'s Word among my friends and to colleagues. I was working in\r\na company and met CA of the company; I was very upset and was always getting\r\nangry on to employees. I went to my cabin and started to reason and I shared\r\neverything of my life, after sharing the Word of God I felt peace in my heart.\r\nEvery day I used come to me and listen to Word of God. From that day I realized\r\nthat God has bigger Plan in life and I has called for His Work among new\r\npeople. To know deeply about Him I went to a Bible College for theological\r\nstudy and to have to better understanding about to Word of God and I want to\r\nserve to Lord till last breath. The specific things which I have learned from there\r\nis \"how to interpret to bible correctly\" and to how the Word of God\r\nis important to all humankind. The most important things I have learned that is\r\nhow to preach to God\'s Word with context. I learned that God\'s ministers lives\r\nare not all easy, many times they have to face &nbsp;problems and circumstances in their lives. They\r\nhave to go through hard situations and people. I completed three years of B.th\r\nprogram. The vision which I have received from God that is to share to Gospel\r\nto people who do not know about Christ and bring them to the Lord by showing\r\nLove, prayer, kindness and caring tom. God has placed me in Ludhiana city as\r\nfull time minister to have burden for new people who really don\'t know Christ\r\nand mainly to fulfil the Great Commission of Jesus Christ according to Matthew\r\n28:16-20. My main vision is to prepare more minister of God from the Church and\r\nrelease them to expand the kingdom of God in different places. Currently I am\r\nplanning to start full tome ministry in Norwala Road at Ludhiana. Hindu people\r\nare in majority there; going to minister among all kinds of mix communities\r\nbecause people have settled there from different states and mostly people\r\nworking as laborers. Some of them have no discipline in their lives, some\r\nchildren don\'t go to schools, and poor families are there, most of them having\r\ndrinking habits. The place is very backward in Ludhiana. It is very challenging\r\nto share to love among them, some of them listen and some of them will not. I\r\nwill start a Sunday school there for those children and through them I get chance\r\nto talk to their parents about Christ. That is how I am planning to start\r\nministry there with prayer and Fasting.</span> I thank you for your support that\r\nis enabling me to do ministry.</span>', 243, NULL, NULL),

As a young person,&nbsp; I was privileged to grow up under the ministry and influence of his dad Pastor Raj Masih, whstarted Siyon Church in 1990.  He was working as a Pastor from 30 years. I was not interested to join ministry because my thoughts and needs belonged to world alone. I wanted to become successful businessman, but God’s plan was different for me. Even though sometimes I got disappointed for being a son of a Pastor, but my parents always help me to grow in Christ. And now I realized that it was abundant grace of God that I took birth in pastor’s house. I trusted Jesus Christ as personal Savior on 2nd March 2008. I can never forget that night when I got saved. I&nbsp; placed faith in Jesus alone to receive forgiveness of sins and to become a part of God’s family. I was attending a convention in my village; Pastor George Stephen preached that God has made us to spread gospel in the world but most of us are wasting lives in earthly things. At that time I recognized that I’m the one who is wasting precious life that God has given me to be His witness. At that time I came down to my knees and cried a lot before Lord Jesus Christ and accepted Him as personal savior. On 26th March 2008, I declared it publicly by taking Baptism.\r\nWhen I started to follow Jesus Christ, I&nbsp;&nbsp;saw changes in life. <br><br>When my family members noticed changes in me, they appreciated me to grow more in the Lord. \r\nIn 2010 after completing 10th class, I joined at Mohali for bachelor in Theology. In 2013, I completed my bachelor studies and started ministry work with local church. On 6th September 2015, I got married with Ramandeep Kaur, she is also ministry minded women and is involved in women and children ministry. In 2017, God blessed us with beautiful daughter Sharon Matthew.\r\n<br><br>My desire is that we can help other families to know the same blessing.  We want to help to pass on from generation to generation a Godly heritage.  We want couples to know marriage and home life the way that God intended it to be - a little taste of Heaven. My goal is that we will be used to see hundreds and thousands of people from every background come to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. From last few years we both are praying for a town in district Moga, Fatehgarh Panjtoor. There is not a single Christian family in that town. We have burden to plant Church in this town, so that perishing souls can have eternal life.

He was telling from the life of our Lord Jesus Christ and about His death and resurrection. That moment was the very heart touching movement when I heard that Jesus Christ gave His life to save me from sin. That evening with broken heart I came to the Lord and accepted Christ  as my personal  Savior  and took Baptism classes from my church and on&nbsp;April 2001 testified the Lord by water Baptism <br><br>After my baptism I was living my life doing my studies along with work. I was praying to the Lord for my future. I got involved in Church ministry like outreach, taking Sunday school but had no conformation of my call. As I was praying and reading scripture I felt the direct call of God from scripture. After the conviction of&nbsp; call to serve the Lord.<br><br>In 2010 I&nbsp; went to a Bible School for two years, to learn the word of God. After I joined ICT program on 2013-14 there I had the re-conformation of God\'s call for the ministry. I&nbsp;started Church planting work in 2014 but due to some kind of persecution I had to move back to home and started praying for a new place to do work of the Lord. I am&nbsp;non- graduate  but taken many training for ministry relatedAs after prayer I decided to move a new place where Santhals, Rajwar ( ST) are prominent . I moved to Barwadda where these tribes are and I know their language too . These tribes has less reach of gospel in that part of Jharkhand. I have a&nbsp;&nbsp;vision to start separate  churches  in Rajwar and Santhals.Illiteracy  and water crisis are the main issues of these tribes. With help of my wife, I am trying to educate women of the village and poor girls to complete their higher education.I thank you for your support that is encouraging me to do ministry, appreciate your prayers for us.

(242, '<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&nbsp;Praise the Lord. Greetings in the name of our\r\nLord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is&nbsp; Bijoy chowdhury.I&nbsp;was born and brought up in a non christian\r\n(Hindu) family, my whole family still doing idol worship because they are&nbsp;&nbsp;Hindu. But I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior on October 1998.&nbsp;When I used to do idol worship at that time I didn’t know so much about Lord Jesus.&nbsp;At that time I only knew that Jesus died on\r\nthe cross through one of my friend who belong to a Christian family .He did\r\nnot tell me so much about Lord Jesus .\r\n\r\nBut when got married, after that I began to\r\nknow about Lord Jesus through my father-in- law and also my wife, because they are belong to a christian background. I got married on 1997&nbsp; and after one&nbsp; year in 1998 there was&nbsp; a\r\nbig 3 days revival meeting which&nbsp; was held in Asansol , on the 3rd day&nbsp; I&nbsp;accepted Jesus as my personal Savior. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After that&nbsp;&nbsp;I came back my house, began to join every\r\nday family&nbsp;&nbsp; prayer service at my\r\nfather-in-laws house. There I began to know about Lord Jesus more and my father in law used to teach me about Jesus\r\nand also he paid for my bible study.&nbsp;So that I can take Bible training and learn\r\nmore about Jesus. After one and half years God answered our prayer. One day\r\nsuddenly one fellow came in to my\r\n\r\nFather-in-laws house after 30 years. It is a&nbsp;miracle that man came, because the past&nbsp;30 years they don’t have any\r\nconnections with each other. Then my father in law&nbsp; shared everything and also about my Bible training, and that time that man told that they&nbsp;have a Bible School in Faridabad (Delhi). And they&nbsp;will take me there for learning word of God.&nbsp;Then after 2 months my self and one of my brother in law went for Bible training in Faridabad (Delhi) in the year 1999 month of July.&nbsp;&nbsp;We went for\r\nbible training at Faridabad from there we come back in the year 2000 after completing one year\r\ngraduation . After that I begun to start to do Lords work in my local area.\r\nIn the mean time , my father kicked me out from the house because I accepted\r\nJesus. I lost my own house .From that time onward I am&nbsp; living in my father in laws\r\nhouse<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From that time itself&nbsp;&nbsp;I started to do ministry. I began to visit many villages ,I went in a district name&nbsp; Pururlia place\r\nname Adra , there&nbsp; I was doing Lords work\r\namong non christian family.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because when I was in the Bible School, God&nbsp; gave me a vision to&nbsp;do His work among non-Christian family.&nbsp;&nbsp;From that day I am\r\nholding my faith and kept it in&nbsp; my mind&nbsp; what God has given me to do. According to my\r\nvision I am doing my Lord\'s work. Still I am serving the lord in Jamurai among non-Christian and trible\r\npeople which is 32 km far from my house. I wanted to do ministry in this place because I have seen how these people were living, their poverty and different needs of their life. By seeing their needs I decided to open New life adult literacy and child development center&nbsp;&nbsp;for them where they can study without any cost.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please keep praying for me so that I can do His work more&nbsp; and more and God may use me mightily.&nbsp; &nbsp;I also take this opportunity&nbsp;to thank you for partnering with us for&nbsp;the mission work that I am doing in this village.&nbsp;Thank you&nbsp;.', 304, NULL, NULL),

I hail from a Christian background and I\r\nhave my wife and mother. My father passed away at my very young age which\r\nbrought the burden of caring us on the shoulders of my mother. Soon I also had\r\nto step into some job to care for the family. Thus I had to stop my studies. I\r\nwent for labor works.<br><b><i><u>Life\r\nbefore Salvation</u></i></b>\r\n\r\n<br>Though\r\nborn in Christian family, a personal relationship with God was a least priority\r\nin my life. I attended Sunday school from very early age but was far from God.\r\nAs I entered the labor works, I got many friends who were into all kinds of\r\nintoxications which paved a way for me to get into such habits. <br><b><i><u>Encounter\r\nwith Christ</u></i></b>\r\n\r\n<br>As\r\nI was living a wretched life, which had no hope and no goal, was thinking I am\r\nall and all. One morning as I was going for the job, I met my evangelist and he\r\nask me ‘how is life’ and I said to him ‘good’. He asked me to come to his house\r\nby evening and I said him ‘ok’. <br>As\r\nI came by evening, I went to his house. As I entered I saw there were already\r\nmany young brothers and sisters those who were with me in Sunday school, sitting.\r\nHe gave me a place to sit and program began with prayer. After the prayer all\r\nof them started to share their testimony, how they encountered Christ and how Lord\r\nJesus Christ changed their life.<br>I\r\nwas thinking what big deal is in that to know Christ personally I know him, I\r\nwent to Sunday school. As I was thinking all these things the evangelist ask me\r\nRamasted ‘do you know Christ’, I said, ‘yes’ the next question he ask me, ‘what\r\ndo you know’, I said the things what I studied in Sunday school and whatever\r\nwas in my mind I said to him. <br><span>After\r\nhearing me, he took the Bible and started to share with me the good news, and\r\nafter hearing I felt yes I m a sinner and I need to be saved. I asked him ‘how\r\nto be saved’? He shared if we confess our sin and accept Christ as our savior\r\nhe will save us. That night I confess my sin and ask Jesus to come in my heart\r\nand I became born again. It was 14th November 2004.<br></span><b><i><u>After\r\nborn again</u></i></b>\r\n\r\n<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>On 31st December 2004 I\r\ntook water baptism and was in fellowship with Kalipathor Brethren Assembly.

(259, 'Greetings in sweet name of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>1.I am Sanjay Mondal. I&nbsp; come from a Roman Catholic  family  , knowing  half- truth about  Christ and Christian  life. I had completed  all rituals  in Catholic  Church as I grew up , but not having  personal  relationship  with Christ . One of the Evangelist visited my area which is full of Christian  Community  families . I happened  to be of same place called Chapra. I received some tracts and started communicating with lots of questions  to the Evangelist. And in that process of follow  up I surrendered my life to Christ  as my Personal  Savior  and the journey  of personal  relationships  with Christ  the Savior  in the year 2011.That time itself my life changed and I found peace in my heart. Now My eagerness was growing day by day to know Christ More and more . Then I decided to go&nbsp;to a  Bible School  for 2 years in BBTI, Jamtara in Jharkhand  in 2012 to systematically  study  the word of God. After two years I came back to my own village  and started helping  the evangelist through whom I knew the Lord.  \r\n\r\nThe pressure  from family  and catholic  community  started coming , so I started doing  secular  work for next two years. But I was not having&nbsp; peace in my heart and feeling  heavy burden to share the good news  to lost people.<br><br>&nbsp;2. As I was praying to God for showing me the way, one find morning  in 2015 I decided to work for the Lord wherever God will leads me&nbsp;&nbsp;but need of my sustaining  also was an issue. So along with my ministry&nbsp; I&nbsp;started to do &nbsp;part time job and visiting in villages  with evangelist  when ever I was free.Though I was busy with my work then also I tried my best to give more time for ministry.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;3.&nbsp; That is how I started praying  for a new place where I should  go and serve the Lord .Then I&nbsp;joined 2018-19 batch of Community Intervention  Program for a year , which is basically  practical teaching  of evangelism with different  approaches  to different  peoples. This program was very much helpful for my ministry. I really had a burden for the people lives at Chakda. I wanted them to be saved. so I started to pray for this particular place.<br><br>&nbsp;4. The people of Chakdah are generally  Bengali speaking and I need to be become one among them first and start children’s  ministry first. Because I realized that those children are really in need of better life and good education, and the economic conditions are not that much good. People over there are not much educated. They are in need.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;5. I am&nbsp;planning  to shift in that area after getting  married on 21st April 2022 and to start working  among children  and women first.So that they may Know Christ and testify Him in their life. Also the children may become educated and I may help the women to become self sustainable.&nbsp;<br><br>6. I&nbsp; will start Free tuition  center with my wife for teenagers , and start Self Help Groups  among women. Then slowly  start sharing  gospel to that area with the help of these teenagers  and women .<br><br>Please pray for me and my wife that we may serve the Lord. Thank you.<br><br>', 325, NULL, NULL),

My father was only person who earned money and was taking care of us. There was no other source of income. My family conditions was very bad. After sometime my father\'s health was not good that time so my mother went for work. I was really murmuring to myself that in this condition I can\'t help my family. No one was there to stand beside us. At this moment I met one of the Sunday school teacher, he knew me because previously I used to go Sunday school there.&nbsp;I shared my problems with him and he supported me. He encouraged me to attend Sunday school and worship service there.&nbsp;I started to go to the Sunday school and church every Sunday. And came to the Lord&nbsp; in year 2011&nbsp; through  an evangelist while I was doing my intermediate  School  education . I took baptism  after one year and started working  in Child Development  Project as accountant as I was pursuing B.com. I was very happy to know about Lord Jesus Christ. I received peace in my heart.<br><br>After my salvation I was praying to God for my future . I was thinking why God has chosen me and what is the purpose . I was praying and reading God\'s word and was waiting for God\'s guidance. God spoke to me through His word and I understood that God wants me to work among poor and needy people . That was my burden also to work among my own people those who don\'t know God and neglected in the society . As I was&nbsp; not want my people to face the same problem as I was facing. I wanted to save them.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;I learned many ministerial aspect while working  in the project but suddenly project got closed  in 2015 and I wanted to serve the Lord. So to know more about  Him and His word I went to a Bible School  for three&nbsp; years. There I studied God\'s word and was able to understand Bible. In 2018 I joined in&nbsp; CIP program and while doing practical evangelism I&nbsp; decided to work among my own people. I started to read God\'s word for more clarity, so that I may be able to work among my own people.<br><br>&nbsp;Lots of prayer and planning  required  to reach that particular  Bengal Community  as there are 4 neglected  castes are found in that area. But I wanted to work among Bengal community because after visiting that place I do realize that those people are discouraged.&nbsp; I felt that I should encourage them to live peacefully in the society without any fear and discouragement.&nbsp;After knowing Jesus Christ my life changed. I wanted to change the lives of other caste people and because of this reason I want to&nbsp;reach different villages, towns and to stand beside them. To settle down in another town from my own village  and from there I will reach surrounding 20 villages. Encouraging People to go forward from there problems and slowly bring them to Christ. And I will establish Church there. I&nbsp;will give them lot of Bengali  gospel literature  and will start&nbsp;free tuition  center initially .I want to do serve those people by giving them education, skill them by computer knowledge,&nbsp; by playing games and spending time with them also by the help of other leader. These are my plans to reach this community.<br>Please pray for me&nbsp;that I may serve the Lord by serving my own people. Thank you&nbsp; &nbsp;for your support that is enabling me to do ministry.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>', 326, NULL, NULL),

(265, 'Praise the Lord. My name is Biswajit Roy. I\'ve came down from Hindu background. Before I came to Christ I was idol worshiper according to the tradition. And I had some responsibilities about yearly idol festival through Hindus community . My previous lifestyle was a disgraceful&nbsp; and disobedient life . Even there was no hope in my life and I was slowly slowly destroying inwardly . In that period one of the brother shared the Gospel on 21.09.2005 and  after hearing the Gospel,&nbsp;I got peace in my heart , and something different, every moment I felt that someone talking when I was all alone . On 24.09.2005, I finally understood the meaning of Gospel and everlasting life and how Christ sacrificed his life for me and what nobody did He did for me , I understood the meaning of sacrifice  . And I accepted the Lord Jesus Christ for getting salvation . So after getting salvation, my personal life started to change. My parents started persecuting me, and they rejected me many times and it is 13 years since they have rejected me. My friends rejected me and relatives also rejected , and some time politician people threatening me that &nbsp;I should not share about Jesus Christ to others in this area . So finally I had been living with my family or relatives&nbsp;. But I always have a&nbsp;peace in my heart . The word of God encourages me everyday and spiritual life is growing day by day . After six months I took baptism and finally I saw happiness in worshiping Christ . My life already separated from  worldly life I finally understood .   And many people also viewed  my life already separated and changed . So now my life have been journeying finally in Christ ,  as well He (Christ) loves me and I want to be with Him, his presence always. When People are doing idol worship according to Hindu tradition and festival and when people dying with out knowing Gospel . In that period I was feeling burdened for them and&nbsp;&nbsp;I need to share the gospel . Because&nbsp;many people are perishing without the gift of&nbsp;eternal life. And when I studied the new testament the book of Jude chapter number 1 and ver.. number 22 and 23 . I understood God is telling me to go and share the gospel those who are living without knowing gospel and living life .&nbsp;I got focus from the scripture and I had started the sharing gospel since 2005. I completed my G.Th from a bible school in Kerala&nbsp;. I\'ve learnt something what is truth and biblical biblical doctrine and sharing the gospel and making the disciple for Him.

We were lower caste in my village and&nbsp;&nbsp;we had to obey and listen to upper caste like brahmin. My dream was to do secular job and support&nbsp; my family. During college time turning point came in my life. Through tracts I came to know gospel and also God\'s love, death and resurrection. Also came to know that He is the living God.From bro. Sanjit Roy I came to know more about Lord the Savior. I accept Lord as my personal Savior on dated 17-07-2013 and was baptized on 23-02-2014.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After my salvation My totally changed .And I am Thankful to God that I could able to leave my bad habits and bad fellowship with friends. By seeing changes in my life my family members and my village people were asking to me so many questions and also they wanted to know where I am going every Sunday. I was thinking in my mind that for giving them answers I have to know more about Bible. And I decided to study in Bible School.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After coming from Bible school I was convinced that I should serve the Lord and then to get more affirmation and knowing more about people groups I joined&nbsp; CIP program in 2018. I got affirmations that I should work in my village and its surrounding villages first with gospel. I&nbsp;learned about communities  in my areas and that help me to decide people group to work in first.\r\n<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Education  is the need of those villages. My concept is if they will become more educated then it will be easy for me to change their mind and bring them to Christ.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Starting full field&nbsp; work with education and SHG groups&nbsp;I planned. By doing these works I want to&nbsp;win them for Christ. So that in future they will be able to convert their mind from idle worshipers to Christ worshipers. And slowly I can establish Church there.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I newly got married. Me&nbsp;and my wife we together want to do ministry&nbsp;with Children club and After School Classes. My vision is that through my life many people should know Christ personally. And I am praying to God that this people may save from the lake of fire and know Lord Jesus the Savior.&nbsp;Thank You.<br><br><br>', 332, NULL, NULL),

I would not be satisfied. I&nbsp; was good in studying. I could remember what my grandfather taught me. Now my parents tell me these things. When I was 8-10 years old. My family</div><div>there were two earning members at that time my grandfather and my father both worked as laborers and farmers. There were eight family members. The total monthly income of two of them were Rs.1600 rupees. I was studying in our village school. I was dear to my grandfather and had a very good relationship with my parents. They took good care of me. There was trouble in the family. There was lack of food, work was almost stopped. Grandpa was getting old. He could not work. I was thinking that when I grow up, I will have a good job. I will take care of my family. There was a lack in the family for which my childhood life was not happy.&nbsp; the family made me unhappy, when I was 12 years old my family was in poverty but When&nbsp; &nbsp;I was 15 years old. I used to be so addicted to alcohol that why people would pick me up and take me home. Family members would cry when they saw my condition. Grandpa, my parents loved me very much, so it was hard for them to think that people would tell my parents a lot of lies about me, my parents would disturb me and then I would leave my life to commit suicide, many times I would leave home I planned to go but when I came back I felt a turmoil in my mind.

(269, 'Praise the Lord. I am Biswajit Debbarma from Tripura. I was born in the year\r\nof 1990 in a small village in Hindu family. As I was born in Hindu family but\r\ndidn’t see much practicing Hindu religion activities. Though I was born in Hindu\r\nfamily but was grown up in Christian environment because one of my uncles was a\r\nChristian. He used to take me to the church every Sunday worship and Sunday\r\nschool. <br><span>I have&nbsp; mom and dad, one bother and one sister. I am the\r\nyoungest son in my family. My parents are farmer as well as labor. We had a\r\nsmall piece of land where my father use to cultivate rice. And that was not enough\r\nto feed my family.&nbsp; My father use to collect\r\nthe fire wood from jungle and sell it for the sake of supporting us. I still\r\nremember my father sold the fire wood just for 70 rupees of Indian. It was the\r\ndaily income my father use to earn. My mom used to work in others paddy field.\r\nThough my parents were poor I had a great opportunity to go to government\r\nschool, and had a lots of support from my family. But still I had a dream to go\r\nto English school. I wanted to speak English like my other friends did. But\r\nthat never happened in my school life. I finished my class ten and left the\r\nschool for some reason. As I grew up we had more expenses in my family and my\r\nparents were not able to support me for my higher study. In one word I wanted\r\nto say that till now my parents are still poor. My father and Mother earn for&nbsp;my family. By the grace of God in the year of between 2017 and\r\n2018 I had a privilege of teach in one of the Nepal schools and serving God. As\r\nan English teacher with the help of my master of arts biblical translation\r\n(Linguistic). I had a privilege to go to Bible school. My parents and family\r\nhave a good report in society because they never drink alcohol and smoke like\r\nothers do in village. I had a good and great opportunity to go to church while\r\nwas young and teenager age. Grace of God my parents got saved in the year of\r\n2001. And I thought myself that now I am a good Christian because my parents\r\nare Christian. I had a lots of opportunity to do good works in my church and\r\nsociety. I thought I am a good citizen of heaven because I did so many good\r\nworks for the Lord. I saw many Christian missionaries from Mizoram who came to\r\npreach in our church and speaking English.<br>&nbsp;As I saw them preaching and speaking\r\nEnglish I wanted to be like them. I was baptized in the year of 2008 but I didn’t\r\nknow anything about salvation. I was forced to baptized because I am already 18\r\nyears old. One day I decided to go to bible school learn the word of God and\r\npreach in English. It was my dream. I told my parents and church about going to\r\nbible school and I started my journey to a bible college in\r\nthe year of 2011. I had a very bad experience in my first year bible college.\r\nOnce afternoon I was attending extra class about the second coming of Christ,\r\nwhile lecturing our professor heard about sinners’ judgement. I had a great fear\r\nand said to my professor that I don’t want to go to hell, in the spot I knelt down and prayed to God along with my professor. But I was baptized in the year\r\nof 2018, I was serving God but still I was afraid and shy to be baptized second\r\ntime. Therefore, I was late to be baptized. Soon after my salvation I ask God\r\nto show me a direction for His work. And God gave me to be a missionary but\r\nstill I was not clear where will I serve God? Finally, He gave me a vision for\r\nBhutan in the year of 2015. By the grace of God, I don’t have any problem by\r\nfollowing Christ. The miracle happened was that my mom was badly sick and about\r\nto die because of sickness. But grace of God she was saved. She had a major\r\noperation in her stomach. </span><span>I took decision I must take\r\nbaptism and follow Jesus’ command. My first baptism was not counted as baptism\r\nbecause there is no baptism before salvation but after the salvation. It was a great\r\nchallenge for me after my salvation to prove God and people that I am saved and\r\nbaptized. I don’t have any specific scripture that I got this calling, I got\r\nthis calling while my friend from Manipur opened the book called operation\r\nworld, he showed me the Asian countries and specially Bhutan. But before I came\r\nto fulltime missionary Matthew 28:19-20 are the most powerful supporting and\r\nencouragement versus in my calling and at the present mission field.<br></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From 2011 to 2015 I did Bth and from 2015 to 2017 I did it\r\nmy linguistic course in a bible college and seminary. I\r\nworked in Nepal from 2017 and 2018 with the world view organization with the\r\nAmerican missionary. I helped translation by checking Greek to English\r\ntranslation. I left the mission work in Nepal in 2019 because my calling was not\r\nfor Nepal but for Bhutan. I want to serve for Bhutan but till now I am not able\r\nto do anything for Bhutan. Praying waiting for Bhutan, as well as serving God in\r\nIndia tea garden area, called Kathalguri. About evangelism,I visit house\r\nto house and person to person. I meet people with family and sometimes makes a\r\nfriend and share the gospel. Discipleship, I take a young people with me from\r\nlocal assembly for Sunday worship and visiting teaching the word of God and\r\nsharing the mission work. I use to give lots of opportunity to help in mission\r\nfield. I always depend on God and ask anything to God. As the world need money\r\nevery people need money but when we come for ministry money is nothing to do\r\nwith ministry.&nbsp;Thanking you for this great opportunity to\r\nshare the testimony of my childhood, my family, before salvation and after\r\nsalvation. \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<br>&nbsp;<br>', 336, NULL, NULL),
